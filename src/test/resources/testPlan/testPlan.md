# Test Plan: Orange HRM Open Source Frontend UI Testing

## 1. Introduction
Purpose: The purpose of this test plan is to outline the approach and strategies for testing the user interface of the Orange HRM open-source frontend.

Scope: This test plan covers functional, usability, compatibility, and accessibility testing of the UI components.

Objectives:

    Validate the functionality of UI features/modules.
    Assess the usability and user experience of the frontend.
    Ensure cross-browser and cross-device compatibility.

Assumptions:

    Test environment setup and access to necessary resources are available.
    Testers have a basic understanding of the Orange HRM application.

    UI design specifications.

## 2. Features to be Tested
- List of UI features/modules to be tested 
  -     Authentication
  -     Dashboard Employee Management 
  -     Leave Management
  -     Timesheets 
  -     Performance Management
  -     Reports

- Prioritization of features/modules based on importance and risk:
  


## 3. Testing Approach
- Methodologies: Black-box testing, exploratory testing
- Types of Testing: Functional testing, usability testing, compatibility testing
- Tools and Technologies: Selenium WebDriver for automated testing, Chrome DevTools for debugging, Screen readers for accessibility testing

## 4. Test Environment
- Hardware Requirements: Standard desktop/laptop computers, mobile devices (optional)
- Software Requirements: Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge browsers
- Devices: Desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones
- Network Configurations: Stable internet connection

## 5. Test Cases
- Detailed test cases for each UI feature/module
- Positive and negative scenarios
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected results
- Actual results (after test execution)
- Defect tracking (if any)

## 6. Test Execution Strategy
- Test execution schedule
- Allocation of resources (testers, devices)
- Test data preparation
- Execution of test cases

## 7. Defect Management
- Defect Reporting Process: Defects will be reported using a defect tracking tool such as Jira.
- Defect Severity and Priority: Defect severity and priority will be determined based on impact and urgency.
- Defect Resolution Workflow: Developers will be responsible for fixing defects. Testers will verify fixes before closing defects.
- Regression Testing: Regression testing will be performed after defect fixes or new feature implementations.

## 8. Test Reporting
- Test execution summary
- Defect metrics
- Test coverage analysis
- Recommendations for improvement
- Test execution summaries, defect metrics, and test coverage analysis will be reported in weekly status meetings and documented in a test report.

## 9. Risks and Contingencies
- Identification of potential risks to testing
  - Risks such as resource constraints, schedule delays, and changes in requirements may impact testing.

- Contingency plans to mitigate risks
  - Contingency Plans: Adequate resources will be allocated, and test schedules will be adjusted to mitigate risks.


## 10. Sign-off Criteria
- Criteria for determining when testing is complete
- Approval criteria for release
- Testing will be considered complete when all critical defects are resolved, and test coverage is satisfactory. A sign-off will be obtained from stakeholders before release.
